Make by running `make` in game directory. Game can be run with `./snake` in the
game directory after making.

Controls are:
* Arrows to turn
* `r` to reset the game
* `f` to toggle first person mode
* `p` to pause/resume the game
* `b` to toggle body between cube and sphere
* `t` to toggle textures
* `s` to toggle skybox

Clicking anywhere on the screen will bring up a menu that allows the user to 
control all functions without having to use the keyboard

Although I didn't manage to implement everything I set out to achieve, I still 
feel that I managed to accomplish quite a bit. I had never written anything 
like snake before, so that was more difficult that I had expected by itself -- 
I also think that I managed to achieve a fair amount of user interactivity, 
using the menu system in GLUT to allow the user to toggle settings.
